# link breaker

- petervandivier/hello-world#4

Repository hosting services will often try to helpfully try to link to commits when they detect a hexadecimal string in a form that is meant to be markdown rendered. I've typically seen these done with 10 or 7 character prefixes. 

What happens to these links when there's link hash collision?
